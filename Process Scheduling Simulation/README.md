# Process Scheduling Simulation

The C program simulates two classic scheduling algorithms:

- First Come First Served 
- Shortest Job First

It calculates and displays each process's Waiting Time, Turnaround Time, and Response Time with average statistics and a Gantt Chart.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository

git clone <your_repo_link>
cd <repo_folder>

2. Compile the C program

gcc scheduling.c

3. Run the executable

./a.out

4. Input the number of processes, the arrival and burst times and get the result
